# S3-Hunter
This tool is a GUI wrapper for S3Scanner that generates potential S3 bucket name combinations from user-provided prefixes/suffixes, scans them using the selected cloud provider, and displays the results in real-time. It includes features to stop scans, clear output, and sort results by the number of objects found.
